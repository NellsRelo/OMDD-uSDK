# About
This is an Unofficial SDK for Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, generated via reflection through RE-UE4SS-generated UHT Headers. Some blueprints from the game have been dummied out, as have some C++ classes.

It also contains a WIP Mod, OMDLib, which will be a general purpose Mod Loader & Utility library helpful for other BP and Lua mods.

This may be used as a base for BP Modding as well as skin/texture modding.
